        <ul> <h3>Steps to Get Invited to a Secret Session From Video:</h3>
            <li>Be an active Swiftie on social media (Tumblr and/or Twitter)</li>
            <li>Be on the lookout for rumblings from the first secret session.</li>
            <li>Taylor would log onto Tumblr at certain times. Always be by your computer to see when shes online</li>
            <li>Make posts that are pointed at Taylor. See image at left. Possibly include if you are in a city where secret sessions happen (New York, Nashville, LA, Rhode Island, etc).</li>
            <li>Reblog/Repost your own post as many times as you can. The Reblog limit on Tumblr is 250.</li>
            <li>Repeat the process indefinitely.</li>
            <li>If you are successful, you will receive a message from Taylor Nation like the one shown in the figure below.</li>
